	Author   : Kaylen Travis Pillay
	Creation : COMP315 - Advanced Programming { Major Group Project }

	Details  : This is the header file for a Player class. A Player object will
			   be used as an abstraction of the player of the over all game.
			   Various functions will be provided for reuse purposes and allowing
			   the demonstration of C++ concepts studied in this course.
